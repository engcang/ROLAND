# README 

This project contains a set of custom ROS message definitions used in several GTEC ROS nodes.

* ```msgs::Ranging``` This message models a range value between a tag and a anchor.
* ```msgs::PozyxRanging``` This message models a range value between a tag and an anchor from a Pozyx tag/anchor. It encapsulates some of the parameters provided by the DW1000, like ranging values and quality measurements.
* ```msgs::DWRanging``` This message models a range value between a tag and an anchor from a EBV1000 tag/anchor.
